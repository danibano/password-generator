# Password Generator

## Description
 I made a random password generator to apply what I've learned in JavaScript thus far. It first ask you how many characters you want your password to be but if you pick a number that's not between 8 and 128, it will prompt you to pick again. It'll then ask a series of questions for what criteria to include in the password and then a password is generated matching the criteria. I learned that arrays can store multiple data types, using Math function to create a random set of characters and using loops to pick from the random set of characters to the users desired amount of characters.
